# macooa-adapter

[macooa](https://macooa.com) has been designed as a full service suite for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises in order to steer business processes online. [macooa](https://macooa.com) comprises projectplans, projectcontrolling, worktimes, holidayplans, cockpit, cost benefit analysis, project organisation, CRM, client / contact data, sales-pipeline and many more. 

This **adapter** connects client and contact data being held in the CRM of [macooa](https://macooa.com) with third-party applications. With this **adapter** you are able to create different application flows. It supports **"Triggers"** (e.g. ``getPersons``, ``getOrganisations``) as well as **"Actions"** (e.g. ``insertPerson``, ``updateOrganisation``, ``deletePerson``, etc.), therefore with this **adapter** you could both read and fetch data from [macooa](https://macooa.com) and write and save data in [macooa](https://macooa.com).
